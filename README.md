# RADFish Cruise App

## Demo Cruise App

### Mock API

This project uses `json-server` to mock API endpoints. The endpoints are defined in the `db.json` file in the root of the project.

The project includes a starter db file `db.json.original`. To use the `json-server` make a copy of `db.json.original` **-->** `db.json`. As you work make edits to the `db` through the API the `db.json` file will be updated. To "reset", just copy the `db.json.original` over `db.json`.

To use the mock API run

```bash
npm run serve:json
```

This should produce the following output letting you know it is running.

```bash
JSON Server started on PORT :5000
Press CTRL-C to stop
