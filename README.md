## Demo Cruise App

### Mock API

This project uses `json-server` to mock API endpoints. The endpoints are defined in the `db.json` file in the root of the project.

To use the mock API run

```bash
npm run serve:json
```

This should produce the following output letting you know it is running.

```bash
JSON Server started on PORT :3000
Press CTRL-C to stop
